# Project K2

**Project K2** assembles a collection of materials about Data Science and Machine Learning. It serves as a record of my learning progress. 

## Why K2?

**K2**, known in China as **Qogir** (乔戈里峰), is the Earth's second-highest mountain after Mount Everest. While most people know the name of the world's tallest mountain, few have any idea which mountain ranks second. The champion we cheer, the runner up we scarcely hear. Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb.

I choose to name this project "K2" to symbolize the challenges ahead in my journey to becoming a data scientist. I am well aware will be a long and arduous road.
